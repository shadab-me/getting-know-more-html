# The first few steps

We have begun learning now with our sessions at AltCampus. The last 10 days have been different from the usual learning. Online learning is difficult but with time hopefully, things will get easier.

## Project
We started out with a 10-day target of finishing the learn.shayhowe.com section. It covers a lot of basic and intermediate concepts in web development mainly HTML and CSS. Topics covered include HTML basics like tags, elements, semantic elements, box model, different types of lists, creating and ordering data in tables, working with media, styling using different types of selectors in CSS, CSS reset, vendor prefixes and so on. And this is just the basic section.
The intermediate section tries to introduce many topics which we'll cover later in detail. These include Sass, HaML, jQuery, accessibility, transitions, animations, RWD, etc.

## Learnings
This was a review session for me as all of this is not new for me. But a review was good, reminding me of many topics that I had forgotten because of lack of use. The other thing I liked was the pressure to complete things within a deadline. In self-learning, lack of motivation can lead to procrastination. This has too often been the case for me too. A disciplined result-oriented project structure is what I need, and I think I have got this at AltCampus.
